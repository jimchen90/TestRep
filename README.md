# bass_biquad
This file is to implement a sox dependency reduction task for bass (with biquad) following (https://github.com/pytorch/audio/issues/260). 
Its method can be based on the implementation of task for treble with biquad from 
(https://github.com/pytorch/audio/blob/master/torchaudio/functional.py#L1025).
Here we want to compare and test the result from sox and our bass_biquad function.
